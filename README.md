Zero - a lightweight jQuery alternative
=======================================

Made more as a learning exercise, and for use in my own projects, where browser
compatibility is not an issue...

## Zero functionality

Not nearly as large a functionality footprint and different API but can perform
similiar tasks.

## Zero browser support

Tested in Chrome 24+ only...

## Zero Unit Tests

Unit Testing in progress, but I haven't really decided on the API yet. So there's
no spec. I will add more in time.
